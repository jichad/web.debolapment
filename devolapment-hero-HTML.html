          <p id="let">The image sharpen function (by Alex R. Austin) provided below seems to be very resource hungry and I couldn't make it work on two different servers - trying to sharpen a 413 x 413 image I ended up with "Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted" or "Internal Server Error" or the script terminated without notice. Because I had no priviliges to change the default memory limit on these servers I started looking for other sharpen functions. I have come across a php Unsharp Mask function which works like a charm on both of the servers I dealt with. It can be found.</p>
